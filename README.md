  > NOTE: (My conclusions from this and other videos) \
  >
  > **Encapsulation**
  >
  > - the idea of bundling data with methods that can operate on that data within a class.
  > - other classes should not _directly_ interact with the data/attributes of another class. \
  >   To access that data **getters** and **setters** should be used. Basically we a hiding the data (attributes/fields/private variables) of a class from other classes.
  >
  > ***
  >
  > **Abstraction**
  >
  > - the idea of hiding the complex implementation details of a class and only showing the necessary features of an object. We do this by creating an interface through which classes can interact with one another.
  >
  > ***
  >
  > **Inheritance**
  >
  > - the principle that allows classes to derive from other classes.
  >
  > ***
  >
  > **Polymorphism**
  >
  > - describes methods that are able to take on many forms
  > - types of polymorphism:
  >   - **Dynamic** or **Run-time polymorphism** - achieved by function overriding
  >   - **Static** or **Compile-time polymorphism** - achieved by function and operator overloading

  - Encapsulation - refers to **bundling data with methods** that can operate on that data within a class. \

    > TODO: Check out the **chess** example from the video.

    Essentially, it is the idea of ~~**hiding data** within a class~~, **preventing anything outside that class from directly interacting with it** (read about setters and getters below). \
    This **does not mean** than members of other classes cannot interact at all with the attributes of another object. \
    Members of other classes can **interact with the attributes of another object through it's methods**. \
    Remember, methods are the **functions defined within the class**. \
    In practice, one way this tends to work, is by creating **getting** and **setting** methods. These methods act to either **get** information from an object, or **set** attributes to different values.

    - Encapsulation - information hiding \
      You may also want some attributes to be **read-only** from the outside:

      - To do this, you would **define a getter method** _but not a setter method_.
      - The variable could **only be referenced**, _not changed_.

      It is generally best to not allow **external classes** to **directly edit an object's attributes**. This is very important when working on large and complex programs. Each piece should not **have access to** or **rely on** the **inner workings of other sections of code**. \
      **Information hiding**, or keeping the data of one class hidden from external classes, helps you **keep control of your program** and **prevent it from becoming too complicated**.

    - Encapsulation - overview \
      Encapsulation is a vital principle in Object-Oriented Programming. \
      Encapsulation:
      - Keeps the programmer in control of access to data
      - Prevents the program from ending up in any **strange or unwanted states**

  - Abstraction - refers to the **process of hiding the complex implementation details** of a class and only showing the necessary features of an object.

    > TODO: Check out the **car** example from the video.

    The classes you create should act like your car. Users of your classes should not worry about the inner details of those classes. \
    This is similar to encapsulation that was discussed earlier. Classes should **not directly interact** with other classes' data (with it's data store). Rather, have them use the classes' methods to access their data. \
    This idea is very important when working on your program incrementally, where you focus on one class at a time and ensure that it works. This is a very useful approach as it can be difficult for you to focus in the big picture while programming and splitting up your project into smaller chunks can make it much more manageable. Furthermore, programs nowadays are very complex to the point where **multiple programmers tend to work on one program/project**. In this case, it's best if the section that you work on is able to function without knowledge of the inner workings of your colleague's section.

    - Abstraction - Interface and Implementation \
      To achieve the previous, it's best to think of your program in terms of **interface and implementation**. \
      **The interface** refers to the way sections of code can **communicate with one another**. This is typically done through **methods** that each class is able to call/access. \
      **The implementation** refers to the **inner workings** of the class (how these methods are coded). This is the **data** and **methods** that should be **hidden** (from other classes), within the class.

      > TODO: Check out the car + chess examples from the video.

      If classes are **entangles**, then one change creates a **ripple effect that causes many more changes**. \
      Creating a set interface through which classes can interact with one another, and hiding the implementation details, can **prevent this ripple effect** so that **each (chess) piece can be individually developed**.

    - Abstraction - overview \
      Abstraction **allows the program to be worked on incrementally** and prevents it from becoming entangled and complex. \
      Determine **specific points of contact** that can act as an interface between classes, and **only worry about the implementation when coding it**.

  - Inheritance - is the principle that allows classes to derive from other classes

    > TODO: Check out the **game** example from the video. \
    > Here is an overview of the example: \
    > The **Weapon** class is the **base class** (also called **superclass**). It has two attributes: **name** and **damageType**. It also has a method **attack()**. \
    > This class contains methods and attributes that are common to all weapons.
    >
    > An example for **damageType** for a sword could be **sharp**. \
    > weapon.damageType = "sharp" \
    > An example for **damageType** for a club could be **blunt**. \
    > weapon.damageType = "blunt" \
    > These differences would be represented in different values for their attributes as well as possibly different attributes altogether. However, they would still have the same methods and attributes that are common to all weapons (because they are both members of the Weapons class).

    ```mermaid
    ---
    title: Inheritance example
    ---
    classDiagram
      class Weapon {
        + name: string
        + damageType: number
        + attack(): void
      }

      class Sword {
        + name: string
        + damageType: number
        + attack(): void
      }

      class Club {
        + name: string
        + damageType: number
        + attack(): void
      }

      Weapon <|-- Sword
      Weapon <|-- Club

    ```

    > The **Weapon** is the **superclass** or **base class**. The **Sword** and **Club** classes are **subclasses** of the **Weapon** class. They **inherit** the attributes and methods of the **Weapon** class! \

    ```mermaid
    ---
    title: Inheritance example
    ---
    classDiagram
      class Superclass {
      }

      class SubclassX {
      }

      class SubclassY {
      }

      Superclass <|-- SubclassX
      Superclass <|-- SubclassY
    ```

    Many of the attributes and methods associated with the **Weapon** class would also be present in the **Sword** and **Club** (sub)classes. \
    Any given sword or club would require the methods and attributes present in the **Weapon** class in order to function. \
    In most cases the **class hierarchy** you create will have many more layers with many more (sub)classes in each layer. \
    For example the **Weapon** class may even be a subclass of a broader **Items** class, which would have many more subclasses of its own etc.

    - Inheritance - access modifiers \
      Inheritance also allows you to **control access** to other classes or attributes and methods of a class. \
      You can **restrict access** to certain attributes and methods to only the **subclass** or **superclass**. \
      This is done through **access modifiers**: \
      - **Public** attributes and methods can be accessed by any class.
        - This is very useful when we want to have access from a wide range of places in our program.
      - **Private** attributes and methods can only be accessed by the class they are defined in.
        - This is best to us if we don't need this information accessed from else in the program. Additionally this allows us to create other private members of the same name in separate classes, which would not conflict with one another due to their private access modifier.
      - **Protected** attributes and methods can be accessed by the class they are defined in and any subclasses of that class.
        - Essentially protected variables are private to the class hierarchy that they are defined in.

  - Polymorphism - describes **methods that are able to take on many forms**
    There are two types of polymorphism:

    - **Dynamic polymorphism**

      - occurs **during the runtime** of the program, when the programs is being executed.
      - this type of polymorphism describes when a **method signature is in both a subclass and a superclass**. \
        The methods share the same **name and parameters**, but the **implementations are different** in each class. \
        The implementation in the subclass **overrides** the implementation in the superclass.
      - in other words, polymorphism allows a method to do different things based on the object that it is called on (because different objects will have different implementations of the method).
        > TODO: Check the "car" example from the video. Here is an overview of the example: \

      ```mermaid
      ---
      title: Polymorphism example; different types of cars in class hierarchy
      ---
      classDiagram
        class Car {
          + drive(miles: number): void
        }

        class SportsCar {
          + drive(miles: number): void
        }

        Car <|-- SportsCar

      ```

      In the **Car** class, we might have an attribute **gas** where {Car.gas -= 0.04 \* miles} because the **.drive()** method may cause the car's gas to decrease by 0.04 gallons per mile. \
      On the other side in the **SportsCar** class, we might have an attribute **gas** where {SportsCar.gas -= 0.02 \* miles} because the **.drive()** method may cause the car's gas to decrease by 0.02 gallons per mile. \
      So, if we create an instance of a sports car named **mySportsCar**, and call the **.drive()** method on it, the **SportsCar** class's implementation of the **.drive()** method will override the generic **Car** version of the **.drive()**. That will cause the gas to decrease by 0.02 gallons per mile.

      This works because the **form of the method** is decided **based on where in the class hierarchy it is called**.

      The implementation of a method signature that will be used is **determined dynamically as the program is run**.

    - **Static polymorphism**

      - occurs **during the compile time** of the program, when the program is being compiled rather than during runtime.
      - refers to when multiple **methods with the same name but different arguments(!)** are defined in the same(!) class.
      - in this case, the methods are differentiated by
        - the **number of arguments** that they take
        - the **type of arguments** that they take
        - the order of the arguments
      - This is known as **method overloading**.

      > TODO: Check the "car" example from the video. Here is an overview of the example: \

      ```mermaid
      ---
      title: Static polymorphism example; different types of cars in class hierarchy
      ---
      classDiagram
        class Car {
          + drive(speed: number, destination: string): void
          + drive(speed: number, distance: number): void
          + drive(destination: string, speed: number): void
        }

      ```

      Method signatures in the previous example are different because they have different **number of arguments**, **types of arguments** and **order of arguments** therefore the computer is being able to differentiate between them when the program is being compiled.

      The implementation of a method signature that will be used is **determined statically as the program is compiled**.

      For example, if we do the `myCar.drive(100, "New York")` the first method will be called. If we do `myCar.drive("New York", 100)` the third method will be called.
